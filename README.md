This repo contains data and code for estimating climate benefits of nutrient management. A summary of the results and methods can be found in the summary document `scripts/Climate-Benefits-of-Nutrient-Management.html`. 

> **Abstract:** 
> Eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs contributes to emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Water management policies that reduce nutrient loadings also reduce eutrophication and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These reductions in GHG emissions have not, to date, been considered when evaluating the costs and benefits of a proposed policy. We integrate biophysical and economic models to estimate the previously unquantified climate benefits of a large nutrient management program in the northeastern United States. The climate benefits of the policy are estimated to be between $207 million to 484 million (2020USD, 2% discount rate) over the first 50 years of the management program. Our estimates suggest that reductions in GHG emissions from nutrient management programs should be taken into account in helping to meet regional, national, and global GHG mitigation goals.  

## Requirements
1. *R* is free and available for download [here](https://www.r-project.org/). The *RStudio* integrated development environment is useful for replication, it is free and available for download [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). *R* is used to collect the estimates from each damage module and create a table of annual SC-HFCs. 

2. Optional: *Github* is free and available for download [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). *Github* is used to house this repository and by installing and using it to clone the repository one will simplify the replication procedure. However, a user could also simply download a zipped file version of this repository, unzip in the desired location and follow the replication procedures outlined below.
